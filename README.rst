The *cmdkit* library implements a few common patterns needed for commandline tools in Python.
It only touches a few concepts but it implements them well.
The idea is to reduce the boilerplate needed to get a full featured CLI off the ground.
Applications developed using *cmdkit* are easy to implement, easy to maintain, and easy to
understand.

|

-------------------

Features
--------

- An ``~cmdkit.cli.Interface`` class for parsing commandline arguments.
- An ``~cmdkit.app.Application`` class that provides the boilerplate for a good entry-point.
- Basic ``~cmdkit.logging``.
- A ``~cmdkit.config.Configuration`` class built on top of a ``~cmdkit.config.Namespace``
  class that provides automatic depth-first merging of dictionaries from local files,
  as well as automatic environment variable discovery.

|

-------------------

Installation
------------

*CmdKit* is built on Python 3.7+ and can be installed using Pip.

.. code-block:: none

    âžœ pip install cmdkit
