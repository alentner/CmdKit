The *cmdkit* library implements a few common patterns needed for commandline tools in Python.
It only touches a few concepts but it implements them well.
The idea is to reduce the boilerplate needed to get a full featured CLI off the ground.
Applications developed using *cmdkit* are easy to implement, easy to maintain, and easy to
understand.

-------------------

Features
--------

- An :class:`~cmdkit.cli.Interface` class for parsing commandline arguments.
- An :class:`~cmdkit.app.Application` class that provides the boilerplate for
  a good entry-point.
- Basic :mod:`~cmdkit.logging` via the `logalpha <https://logalpha.readthedocs.io>`_ package.
- A :class:`~cmdkit.config.Configuration` class built on top of a
  :class:`~cmdkit.config.Namespace` class that provides
  automatic depth-first merging of dictionaries from local files,
  as well as automatic environment variable discovery and type-coercion.

-------------------

Installation
------------

*CmdKit* is built on Python 3.7+ and can be installed using Pip.

.. code-block:: none
